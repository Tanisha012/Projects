📊 Project Description:
I recently completed a project focused on analyzing cricket player performance to select an optimal team capable of scoring 180+ runs and defending 150+ runs on average. Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive dashboard to evaluate players across batting, bowling, and all-rounder roles based on predefined performance parameters.

🚀 Highlights:
Defined key performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, bowling economy, and dot ball percentage.
Created dynamic filters for role-specific analysis (openers, middle-order, finishers, bowlers, and all-rounders).
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize player performance and identify the best combinations for a balanced team.
Enabled data-driven decision-making for optimal team selection.
💻 Skills Applied: Data visualization, performance analysis, and Power BI dashboard design.

🔍 What I Learned:
This project enhanced my ability to use Power BI for parameter-based data scoping and build dashboards that align with strategic goals.
